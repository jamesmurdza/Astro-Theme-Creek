It will guide you through the process of creating and running a full-stack app using an LLM to write the code. You can also check out the code produced for this example <a href=\"https://github.com/gitwitapp/doodle-app/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n\n## Generate a repository\n\nTo create a new project, click New Project and enter a prompt. The prompt can be anything but it helps if you write your prompt as if you’re talking to a junior developer. This means to use specific language such as “A full-stack app that allows users to browse available vacancies and make bookings.” rather than “An app like AirBNB”. If you like you can specify a stack, or omit this part to let GitWit choose one for you.\n\n<img src=\"/images/1.gif\" />\n\nI wanted to make a drawing app where the user could draw with their mouse, so I used the prompt: “A full-stack app that allows users to draw doodles with their mouse.”\n\n<img src=\"/images/2.gif\" />\n\nAfter about 90 seconds, GitWit had generated a project containing code for an EspressJS app. This included a simple JavaScript frontend with the drawing code, a backend recieving events from the frontend, a .gitignore, the required dependencies, and a README.\n\nAnother short tip: You can generate multiple repositories at the same time with GitWit. Thus, you might try generating two repositories from the same prompt to see which comes out better.\n\n## Test the app\n\nSo now for the moment of truth: The code has been generated and it looks OK, but does it work? In GitWit, it's possible to launch a new GitHub codespace to run and test the generated code.\n\n<img src=\"/images/4.gif\" />\n\nI followed the instructions in the README generated by GitWit:\n```\n# How to run the app\n- Install dependencies with npm install\n- Start the server with node server.js\n- Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser\n```\n which started the app within the codespace. And the results are below!\n\n<img src=\"/images/3.gif\" />\n\nBig note: This project worked the first time with no errors, which does not always occur. GitWit is (mostly) not magic! The generated code is a work-in-progress, and as you will see in the next post, debugging is still a key part of developing software with GitWit.\n\nWant to try GitWit?
